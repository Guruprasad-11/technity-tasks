# Chapter 1


1. The operators are / , and + . The values are 'hello' , -88.8 , and 5.

2. The variable is spam ; the string is 'spam' .

3. Three data types introduced in this chapter are integers, floating-point numbers, and strings.

4. An expression is a combination of values and operators. All expressions evaluate to a single value.

5. An expression evaluates to a single value, whereas a statement does not.

6. The variable bacon contains the value 20 after the code runs.

7. Both expressions evaluate to the string 'spamspamspam' .

8. Variable names cannot begin with a number, but they can contain numbers.

9. The three functions that can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value are int() , float() , and str() .

10. This expression causes an error because you cannot concatenate a string and an integer using the + operator. To fix it, you can convert the integer to a string using the str() function: '1 have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.' .
